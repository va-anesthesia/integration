## DSS Clinical Information System (CIS)-DataBridge


#### Description
https://www.oit.va.gov/Services/TRM/ToolPage.aspx?tid=8969#

* DSS Clinical Information System (CIS)-DataBridge is a software interface solution that filters patient data information from Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) and Clinical Patient Record System (CPRS) to a commercial Intensive Care Unit (ICU)/Anesthesia record keeping (ARK) system. 
* This technology also exports patient and milestone data into VistA for viewing, making it possible to achieve interoperability between VistA and external Health Information Technology (HIT) systems.
* Data is stored within Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA). 


#### Contracts and Cost
* DSS Databridge is currently sold directly to each VISN under a separate contract.
* The cost for one VISN was $1.4m / 5 years, or $280k /year
* https://www.fedhealthit.com/2020/07/va-awards-5-year-cis-databridge-contract-to-dss/
* There are a total of 24 VISNS: https://www.va.gov/directory/guide/map.asp?dnum=1
* According to DSS: All 24 VISNs have a contract for DSS Databridge
* The total annual cost to VA for DSS Databridge is therefore approximately 24 x $280k, or $6.2 million/yr

Note:  The DSS Databrdige is a single product implemented with no modification to each of the VISNs, so there is no business or technical reason why it could not be sold as a single enterprise-wide contract. There were discussions in VA about implementing a national contract for DSS Databridge in 2016, but this was never executed.

* Electronically records patient vitals, drugs, fluids and events
* Improves patient outcomes by capturing data from initial admissions to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU)
* Streamlines data mining, recording and storage of ARK and ICU data
* Accesses current patient data at the point of care in real time
* Seamlessly Records Vitals, Drugs, Fluids, and Events
* Paperless Work Flow; VistA/CPRS & VistA Imaging Integrated
* Captures Data from Admissions to the PACU for Quality Care
* Facilitate Data Mining, Records and Stores ARK & ICU Data.

OTHER DSS VISTA INTEGRATION TOOLKITS
 
 VistA SOA
* VistA Service Oriented Architecture (VSOA) is an enterprise-grade server and application development framework that provides flexible and powerful middle-tier “scaffolding” upon which to build any kind of services-based application.  

DSS Integration Framework
* HL7 interface engine that allows for bi-directional data exchange. Integration Framework transmits information from VistA to a COTS application based on HL7 events and allows COTS systems to send HL7 data to VistA. 

DSS VistA Gateway
* This toolkit allows rich client application developers to retrieve data out of VistA and input data into VistA using well documented VistA RPC Broker calls in a variety of packages.
